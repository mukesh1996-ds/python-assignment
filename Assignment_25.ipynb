    "As we discussed earlier, trying to perform technical analysis without using stock charts is like trying to build a house without owning land! So we must try to understand how to read the charts. But before we get to that, let’s try to answer the question, what is a stock chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Put in the simplest possible terms, it is a graphical representation of how a stock’s price or trading volumes have changed over time. This relationship can be presented in a number of ways, through the use of different types of charts. It is your job, as a technical analyst, to identify the type that will bring out a hidden trend most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock charts, like all other charts, have two axis—the vertical axis and the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis represents the historical time periods for which a technical chart has been constructed. The vertical axis displays the stock price or the trading volume corresponding to each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of charts that are used for technical analysis. However, the four types that are most common are—line chart, bar chart, point and figure chart and candlestick chart. We will discuss these technical charts extensively later. However, we have illustrated three types of stock charts below. The bar chart looks a lot like the candlestick chart. All the charts displayed below are stock price charts. The nature of the input may, however, have to be altered when you move from one chart type to another.\n",

    "Now that you are familiar with the different types of charts, the next thing you want to understand is how to read them. Before doing so, though, let us look at trend lines and trend lengths – the principal tools used for the analysis of technical charts. Let’s look at them individually:\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend lines: A trend line is a straight line that connects all the tops or bottoms in stock charts with each other. We touched upon trend lines in one of the previous sections. Here, we concern ourselves more with their utility.\n",
    "Trend lines are essential because trends are sometimes not so-clearly visible in technical charts. How often we see zigzag patches! They make stock analysis tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce this distortion, an external aid has to be used. Take the example of the line chart we saw earlier. We have reproduced it below with a few additional touches. Look at the section that has been highlighted. At the outset, there is no clear reason to say whether the price trend is upwards or downwards. Tops and bottoms in this section are not clearly going higher or lower conclusively. How, then, will you go about your chart analysis here? Using trend lines may prove helpful as they may be able to cut through the confusion here. We have done just this.\n",
